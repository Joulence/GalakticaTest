# Galaktica Test README

## Project Overview

This project is a test work submission for [Galaktica]. It demonstrates my proficiency in using CSS animations, SCSS, Gulp, HTML, and JavaScript to create a web-based application or website.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to create this project:

1. HTML: The project's structure and content were built using HTML, providing a solid foundation for the web application.

2. CSS Animations: CSS animations were utilized to add visually appealing and interactive elements to the website, enhancing the user experience.

3. SCSS (Sass): SCSS, a powerful CSS preprocessor, was used to write modular, maintainable, and organized CSS code. It allows for the use of variables, mixins, and nested rules, making CSS development more efficient.

4. JavaScript: JavaScript was implemented to add dynamic and interactive functionality to the project. It provides a wide range of possibilities for enhancing user interactions.

5. Gulp: Gulp was used as a task runner to automate various development processes. It can handle tasks such as compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying files, and optimizing assets, streamlining the development workflow.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

```
project/
|-- dist/
|   |-- css/
|   |-- img/
|   |-- js/
|   |-- index.html
|-- src/
|   |-- html/
|   |-- img/
|   |-- js/
|   |-- scss/
|   |-- index.html
|-- .browserslistrc
|-- .gitignore
|-- gulpfile.js
|-- package-lock.json
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
```

1. `dist`: This directory contains the production-ready files generated by Gulp. The optimized CSS, JavaScript, and image files will be placed here.

2. `src`: This directory contains the source files of the project.

3. `gulpfile.js`: This file defines the Gulp tasks, such as compiling SCSS, minifying files, and optimizing images.

4. `package.json`: This file lists the project's dependencies and other metadata required for running Gulp tasks.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

3. Navigate to the project root directory in the terminal.

4. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the Gulp tasks and serve the project:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Your web application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/` in your web browser.


7. To build the project:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to have an active internet connection if the project uses any external resources or libraries (e.g., fonts, APIs).

- Check the browser compatibility of the CSS animations and JavaScript features used in the project to ensure a consistent user experience across different browsers.
